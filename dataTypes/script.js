/* 
The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:

Seven data types that are primitives:
Boolean ====> true and false.
null ====> A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)
undefined ====> A top-level property whose value is not defined.
Number ====> An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
BigInt====> An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
String ====> A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy".
Symbol ====> A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
